# tic-tac-toe-ai
Triangular tic-tac-toe game with artificial intelligence 

The game is played on the board in the shape of a right triangle with equal legs (with a length specified by a user). The aim of the game is to draw a given number of symbols (user specified) in a line horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 

Three kinds of players are implemented:
- random (making random moves)
- human (asking a human for a move to perform)
- AI

AI is implemented as a negamax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and iterative deepening.
